Welcome to the Developer Essentials Book! I designed for this book for the people who;
* are in on-boarding process in a new company or a role
* buys a new notebook
* wants to learn some new tips and tricks in their daily life to make things easier

Unlike traditional books, this is my blog book where I consistently update whenever I learn something new that helps my 
life easier and must have technique for all developers. Major difference between the blog posts; I will not focus on a 
specific domain of a technology rather it will be a baby step before you take any action in that technology like **How to
switch different java versions easily in your local?**

## How to read this book?
If you start from scratch, you should keep the order in the menu where each of them depends on the previous one. But feel free
to skip the chapter if you need to, e.g: skip  Package Manager chapter if you already have HomeBrew/Chocolate installed in your local.
